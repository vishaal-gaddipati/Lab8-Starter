Since graceful degradation is when we start with higher level technology and cut down to lower levels with grace, this can be connected to the local first use of Service Workers because they are both employed to enhance and improve the experience of the user. On one hand, graceful degradation may require to strip some features to support a subset of users with a different browser. Similary, Service Workers can improve user experience by accomodating for lower end devices and even the lack of internet in some cases. Both of these improve the versatility of an application and the overall experience a user has. Offline support is also a form of graceful degradation.<br/>
